Every fenced leaf is identified by its PATH, so the fence assumes the directory

``mv`` and ``ln -s`` were not, so

    mv ~/.kiro/crew /tmp/stash && ln -s /tmp/evil ~/.kiro/crew

left every fence naming a file that is no longer there, and the next write to
``security_policy.json``, ``profiles/``, ``admission_policy.json`` or
