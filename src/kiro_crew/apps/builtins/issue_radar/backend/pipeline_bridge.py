"""Bridge an external pipeline's event log onto the crew ledger's stage model.

WHAT THIS IS FOR. Kiro Crew's own GitHub automation runs as a set of scheduled
scripts that append structured events to their own audit log: ``scan``,
``triage``, ``implement_start``, ``pr_opened``, ``pr_green``, ``implement_done``
and so on. That log records WHAT HAPPENED. It does not record WHERE EACH ITEM
IS, and those are different questions: a reader can reconstruct the history from
it, but nothing can answer "which stage is issue #123 in, and how long has it sat
there" without replaying every line and knowing what each event implies.

The crew ledger already answers exactly that question — an ordered phase spine
(:data:`~crew_store.PHASES`), one current phase per work item, one appended line
per transition, and terminal exits off the spine. The Auto Triage Pipeline board
draws that shape. So the gap between "an automation that works" and "an
automation you can see" is not a missing UI and not a missing ledger: it is one
missing layer of semantics on events that are already being written.

This module is that layer. It takes an event log plus a STAGE TABLE — a mapping
from the pipeline's own event names to phases on the spine — and replays it into
the crew ledger. The board then draws the pipeline with no frontend change at
all, because it is reading the shape it already knows.

WHY A TABLE AND NOT A WALK. The mapping is data, declared by whoever configures
the pipeline, not a chain of ``if`` branches in here. That is the whole point of
the exercise: a second pipeline with different stage names ships a different
table and needs no code in this module. :data:`GH_AUTOFIX_STAGES` is the first
such table and describes Kiro Crew's own automation; it is an example of the
contract, not a privileged case.

WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO.

* It registers no route and no MCP tool. It is a library plus a ``main`` for
  script use, so it adds nothing to any always-on surface and costs an agent
  session no context.
* It never writes to the source log. Replay is one-directional, so a bridge that
  is wrong can be re-run after a fix without having corrupted its input.
* It does not invent a phase. An event whose name is absent from the table is
  skipped and counted, never guessed at — a table that is missing an event is a
  reported gap rather than a lane that quietly drifts to the wrong column.

WHAT A HISTORICAL REPLAY CANNOT GIVE YOU. The ledger stamps its own clock, so a
replay of a log written over days produces lanes whose STAGES are right and whose
DWELL is not: every transition lands at replay time, and the board's "how long
has this sat here" reads as minutes. That is a property of replaying history, not
a defect to patch here — passing the source event's ``ts`` through would let a
caller backdate the ledger, which is a write the ledger deliberately does not
offer. The target shape is a LIVE bridge: the pipeline calls :func:`record_stage`
as each event happens, and then the dwell is real because the clock is. Replay
exists to make an existing log drawable at all, and to prove the table before
anything is wired live.

ONE CREW PER WORK ITEM, AND WHY. ``crew_store`` refuses a second item entering
an editing phase within one crew, because a crew is one worker and a worker
edits one thing at a time. The automation this bridges runs its fix sessions
CONCURRENTLY — several items can legitimately be in ``implementing`` at once —
so mapping the whole pipeline onto a single crew would hit that refusal on the
second concurrent item. Each session is an independent worker on one item, so
the faithful mapping is one crew per work item. The board draws one lane per
work item either way, and the per-crew editing cap then reports one editing item
per crew, which is the truth rather than a fabricated conflict.

    The count is the point of the tuple. An append interrupted mid-write leaves a

    malformed line can swallow a real transition, and skipping it silently makes
    a lane show a stale phase with nothing to say why. Returning the count lets
    every caller report the loss, which is what turns a silent gap into a visible
    one.

    Malformed lines are still SKIPPED rather than fatal. A torn line must not hide
    the history in front of it -- the same discipline ``crew_store.read_events``
    applies to its own ledger -- and refusing the whole log over one corrupt byte
    would make a 3,000-line pipeline undrawable for a defect that cost it a single
    transition. Visibility is the fix here; refusal would be a worse trade.

    The path is operator-supplied (``main`` takes it as an argument), so the read
    goes through ``hooks.safe_read_file_bytes`` rather than ``Path.read_text``:
    that is the centralized ``is_sensitive_path`` enforcement, and it canonicalizes
    via realpath and opens with ``O_NOFOLLOW``, so a path -- or a symlink -- aimed
    at a credential store is refused before any byte is read instead of ending up
    in a ledger line. A new read path that skips the central gate is a bypass even
    when the operator owns the machine.

    :class:`hooks.FileTooLargeError` from that helper, which is re-raised here as

    """Replay a pipeline's log into a repo's ledger, or report a table's coverage.

    The operator-facing half of this module, and the reason it is a script rather
    than a route: populating a board from a log is something a person does
    deliberately, against a path only they know, and it must not become a
    request any session can make.

    ``--dry-run`` reports coverage and writes nothing, which is the order to do
    this in: read which of your event names the table maps, decide whether the
    unmapped ones are housekeeping, and only then replay.

    EVERY refusal in this module reaches the operator as one bounded, escaped
    line and a nonzero exit. That is enforced by wrapping the whole flow in a
    single :class:`BridgeError` guard rather than by catching at each raise site:
    three separate rounds of review found a NEW raise escaping ``main``
    uncaught -- the reader, the crew-collision check, the populated-root
    precondition -- because a per-site catch has to be remembered again every
    time a refusal is added. One guard around the body cannot be forgotten.
