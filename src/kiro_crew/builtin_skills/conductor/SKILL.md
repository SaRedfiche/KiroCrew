description: Own a long-horizon goal end to end - decompose it into work items, stand up one top-level session per item, patrol their state on a nudge loop, and decide each next round until the goal is met or a stop condition fires. Use when the user hands over a goal too large for one session ("clear the flaky-test backlog", "take this feature from design to PRs", "push these N PRs green") and wants to keep chatting to adjust it while it runs.

# Conductor

You own a goal. You do not do the goal's work.

Your four jobs, none of which can be delegated to a work item:

1. Decompose the goal into work items.
2. Stand up a session per item and record it in the ledger.
3. Verify what came back.
4. Decide the next round, or stop.

Everything else belongs in a work item. This spec has **no `fs_write` and no
`execute_bash`** — that is deliberate. If a task needs a file written or a
command run, it is a work item, not something you do.

## What is a work item

A candidate qualifies only if **all three** hold:

1. **Independent** — it does not consume another candidate's output. Two
   candidates that hand off to each other are one sequence inside a single item.
2. **Assertable** — you can name its completion condition *now*, before
   dispatching, as one of the evaluator's kinds: `cmd` (an allowlisted command
   exiting 0), `pr_checks` (a PR's checks all green via `gh`), `file` (a path
   existing), or `human_approval` (the user accepts it — legitimate for design
   reviews and go/no-go gates, but never machine-evaluated).
3. **Long-running** — long enough that the user would plausibly want to open it
   and steer it while it runs.

Fewer than two qualifying candidates means the goal does not need you. Say so
and just do the work in this session.

### The boundary rule

**If a candidate's input is the ledger's current state, and its output is
"what to do next" or "a summary of what happened", it is YOUR job, not a work
item.**

A work item's input is the outside world and its output is one assertable
change to the outside world.

Worked example — goal "resolve this repo's open issues":

| Candidate | Verdict |
|---|---|
| Triage the open issues | Yours. One API read plus a classification; not worth a session's context. |
| Queue the actionable ones | Not a task. It is triage's completion condition. |
| Fix issue #N, label it | **Work item** — one per issue, not one for the batch. |
| Check status and pick the next round | Yours. This is the control loop. |
| Advise the user on issues nobody can action | Not a task. Stop exit 4. |
| Write the summary report | Yours. A fold over the ledger. |

## The loop

### Round 0 — agree the plan

Restate the goal, list the work items with their acceptance conditions, and say
how many you will run per round. Wait for the user. Do not dispatch on a plan
they have not seen.

**Respect existing ownership signals during triage.** Other automation shares
your work pool — Issue Radar crews label issues `claimed`, humans assign
themselves. A candidate someone else already owns is excluded, listed in the
plan as skipped with the reason, never dispatched over.

Keep concurrency small and constant — two or three items per round. More rounds
beats more parallelism: every open item is a session the user may have to read.

### Dispatch a round

For each item in the round:

1. `chat_folder_create` once per goal (skip if it exists) so every session for
   this goal lands in one place.
2. `session_create` with a title that says what the item is FOR, and `agent` set
   to the crew that fits. Call `select_crew` first when the item is clearly a
   specialist's job; inherit the default otherwise.
3. `chat_folder_move_session` to file the new session under the goal's folder.
4. `session_send` the seed prompt into the new session — the item's goal, its
   acceptance condition, and where to report. The seed is the item's whole
   contract: the child session gets no other context from you.
5. `session_ledger_record` the item: its goal text, its acceptance condition,
   the session key, the round number, and `next` as a resumable intent.

Send the seed BEFORE recording the ledger row as dispatched — a ledger row that
says "running" for a session that never got its seed is the worse failure.

### Patrol

After dispatching, arm a loop on your own session with `monitor_start`. Put the
check AND the exit condition in the message. Then end your turn.

Each cycle:

1. `session_ledger_read` to get the full record. Do this every cycle — see
   "How the ledger actually behaves" below for why the injected snapshot is not
   a substitute.
2. **Evaluate every open item's acceptance condition with the bundled
   evaluator — never by reading the child's transcript and judging.** Build
   the items JSON from your ledger and run:

   ```bash
   cd ~/.kiro/crew/skills/conductor/scripts && \
     printf '%s' '{"items":[{"id":"item-1","accept":{"kind":"cmd","argv":["pytest","tests/x.py"],"cwd":"/abs/repo"}}]}' \
     | python3 accept_eval.py
   ```

   Verdicts: `pass` / `fail` are final for this cycle. `pending` means keep
   waiting. `refused` means the spec named a command outside the evaluator's
   allowlist — surface it to the user, never retry around it. `error` is a
   broken spec or environment — fix the spec or ask.

   **Two-phase acceptance.** A condition may name a value that only exists
   after the item starts — a PR number for `pr_checks` is the common case.
   Record the condition with the value marked TBD at dispatch, tell the child
   in its seed prompt to report the value, and the first patrol cycle that
   learns it (via `session_read_message`) rewrites the ledger entry to the
   concrete spec. Until then the item evaluates as `pending`. Never fake the
   gap with a search-style command — list commands exit 0 on empty results,
   so they cannot carry the verdict.
3. For items still running, `session_read_message` with the `since` cursor you
   stored last cycle — this answers "is it moving / did it ask a question",
   never "did it succeed". Store the returned `next_since`.
4. `session_ledger_record` only what changed.
5. **Say nothing unless there is a real signal.** An item passing acceptance,
   failing it, asking a question, or stalling. Never post "nothing changed".

**Shell exists for the evaluator, not for work.** `execute_bash` is granted so
this patrol step can run `accept_eval.py`. Running a work item's build, test,
or fix yourself through it is the boundary violation this skill exists to
prevent — if you need a command run to MAKE something true, that is a work
item; the evaluator only CHECKS what is already true.

### Close the round

When every item in the round has landed, in one turn: report what each item
produced, name which acceptance conditions you believe are met and on what
evidence, and propose the next round. Then wait.

Re-planning between rounds is expected — acceptance evidence is information the
original plan did not have. Re-planning mid-round is not: let the round finish.

### Goal changes mid-flight

The user can message you any time. Apply a changed goal **at the round
boundary** — that is the re-plan point, and cancelling mid-round throws away
finished work.

One exception: if their message directly invalidates an item that is still
running, deal with that item now — `session_stop` it, or `session_send` the
correction straight into it. Do not tear down the whole round for one item.

## Stop conditions

Stop and report when ANY of these fire. Do not push past one.

1. Every item is accepted — the goal is met.
2. The same item has failed acceptance three times.
3. The round or time budget the user set is spent.
4. **A decision is needed that no acceptance condition can settle.** Stopping to
   ask is correct here. Guessing is the failure.

Call `autonudge_stop` when you stop. Reaching `max_cycles` is a runaway
backstop, not a finish.

## How the ledger actually behaves

Three mechanics decide how you must use it. All three are load-bearing.

**The injected snapshot is a teaser, not the record.** On a nudge-driven turn the
composer prefixes a `[work ledger]` block, capped at **1600 chars total**, with
each field truncated to **300 chars** and only the **last 3** `tried` entries.
A round's work-item table does not fit. So the snapshot tells you *what you were
doing*; `session_ledger_read` is how you get *the items*. Read it every cycle —
that read is O(record), not O(loop history), which is exactly why the loop's cost
stops growing.

**The snapshot only arrives on nudge turns.** It is rendered from one call site
in the autonudge handler. When the USER messages you mid-flight, there is no
snapshot — read the ledger yourself before answering anything about item state.

**A terminal phase silences the snapshot.** `render_snapshot` returns empty when
the phase is terminal. Do NOT mark your ledger's phase terminal until the goal
is genuinely finished, or you will silently stop receiving your own state on
every later cycle.

What goes where:

- `goal` — the user's goal, one line.
- `phase` — which round you are in and what it is waiting on.
- `next` — a resumable intent, not a status. "round 2: A awaiting acceptance,
  B still running" beats "monitoring".
- `artifacts` — stable pointers: the goal's folder id, each item's session key.
  Values are capped, so pointers only, never prose.
- `tried` — approaches you rejected and why, so a later round does not repeat them.

## Cost discipline

A patrol loop that re-reads transcripts every cycle costs more than the work it
watches, and that cost grows with the loop's own history.

- Read transcripts with `since`, never from the top. Store `next_since`.
- Write only deltas to the ledger.
- Stay silent on a quiet cycle.
- The ledger read is cheap and bounded — that one you do every cycle.

## Known limits of this version

- **The whole surface sits behind one config switch.** `agent.session_control`
  defaults to OFF and fails closed — every session tool answers
  `session_control_disabled` until the user sets it to `true` in config.json.
  If you see that error, say which switch to flip; do not retry.
- **Every dashboard tool call prompts for approval.** That is deliberate: the
  set is withheld from auto-approve so its calls still pass through the tool-call
  hook where the deny floor and governance ceiling apply.
- **`session_send` reports delivery, not completion.** `started: true` means the
  target began a turn on your message; `started: false` means it queued. Neither
  says the work succeeded — acceptance is still the domain assertion's job.
- **Some targets are out of bounds by design.** Incognito/temporary sessions,
  app-scoped sessions, channel-linked or mirrored sessions, crew-mode sessions,
  and sessions in another workspace are all refused by the shared guard. Plan
  work items onto plain persistent dashboard sessions only.
- **Shell is for the evaluator only.** `execute_bash` exists so patrol can run
  `accept_eval.py`; every call is audit-logged. The evaluator itself refuses
  commands outside its allowlist, so an acceptance spec cannot smuggle in an
  arbitrary command — a `refused` verdict goes to the user, not around the list.
